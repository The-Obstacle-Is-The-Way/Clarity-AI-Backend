# Clarity AI Backend - Dependency Management Modernization PRD

## Project Overview
Modernize the Clarity AI Backend dependency management system to enterprise-grade standards suitable for Y Combinator technical review while maintaining zero breaking changes to existing functionality.

## Background
The current FastAPI backend has solid dependency management foundations but needs modernization to meet 2025 enterprise standards. The project currently uses pip + requirements.lock with comprehensive security scanning, but lacks modern tooling, automated updates, and real-time supply chain protection.

## Current State
- FastAPI 0.115.12 backend with 1,400+ passing tests
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Security tools: semgrep, bandit, safety, pip-audit
- ML/AI stack: torch, transformers, scikit-learn, xgboost
- Healthcare/HIPAA compliance requirements
- Complex dependency tree with 311 packages in requirements.lock

## Goals
1. **Zero Breaking Changes**: Maintain all existing functionality and test suite
2. **Enterprise Security**: Implement real-time supply chain protection
3. **Modern Tooling**: Migrate to UV for performance and modern dependency resolution
4. **Compliance**: Generate SBOMs and license compliance documentation
5. **Automation**: Implement automated dependency updates and security scanning
6. **Y Combinator Ready**: Meet enterprise technical review standards

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Assessment & Documentation (No Changes)
- Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- License compliance audit and documentation
- Dependency vulnerability baseline assessment
- Current dependency tree analysis and visualization
- Container security scanning baseline

### Phase 2: Security Enhancement (Additive Only)
- Install and configure Safety CLI Firewall for real-time protection
- Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Implement Dependabot for automated security updates
- Container security scanning integration
- Security policy documentation

### Phase 3: Modern Tooling Migration (Careful Migration)
- Install and test UV compatibility
- Create UV-based dependency resolution parallel to existing
- Test UV performance and compatibility with existing stack
- Gradual migration strategy with rollback capability
- Update Docker builds to use UV where beneficial

### Phase 4: Automation & Compliance
- Set up Renovate for advanced dependency update automation
- Implement automated SBOM generation in CI/CD
- License compliance monitoring automation
- Dependency drift detection and alerting
- Enterprise reporting and dashboards

## Constraints
- Must maintain HIPAA compliance requirements
- Cannot break existing 1,400+ test suite
- Must maintain Docker build compatibility
- Cannot disrupt ML/AI model training workflows
- Must preserve existing security tool integrations (semgrep, bandit)
- Cannot change core FastAPI application structure

## Success Criteria
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Docker builds remain functional and fast
- Security posture improved with real-time protection
- Dependency resolution speed improved by 50%+
- Automated dependency updates reduce manual work by 80%
- SBOM and compliance documentation generated automatically
- Y Combinator technical review requirements met

## Technology Stack
- **Current**: pip, requirements.lock, pyproject.toml
- **Target**: UV, uv.lock, Safety CLI Firewall, Renovate
- **Maintain**: semgrep, bandit, safety, pip-audit
- **Add**: cyclonedx-py, pip-licenses, trivy

## Risk Mitigation
- All changes must be reversible
- Parallel implementation before migration
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Staged rollout with monitoring
- Rollback plans for each component

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1-2 days (assessment)
- Phase 2: 3-5 days (security enhancement)
- Phase 3: 1-2 weeks (tooling migration)
- Phase 4: 1-2 weeks (automation)

## Key Stakeholders
- Development team (zero disruption requirement)
- Security team (enhanced protection)
- DevOps team (improved automation)
- Y Combinator technical reviewers (compliance demonstration)
