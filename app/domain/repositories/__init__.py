"""
Domain Repository Interfaces.

This package contains repository interfaces defined at the domain layer.
These repositories define the contract for accessing domain entities without
specifying implementation details, following the Repository pattern from DDD.

Domain repositories define the conceptual contract while infrastructure implementations
provide the concrete data access mechanisms.
