This package contains tests for the AWS XGBoost service implementation
using clean architecture principles and SOLID design.

# Empty the __init__.py file to avoid package conflicts with the real xgboost package
# We'll use relative imports in the test files instead

# This marks the directory as a package but doesn't import any submodules
# that might conflict with pytest's collection mechanism
