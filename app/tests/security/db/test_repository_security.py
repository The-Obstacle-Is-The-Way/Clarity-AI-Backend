"""
Repository Security Tests

These tests verify that repositories handling PHI/ePHI properly:
    1. Encrypt sensitive fields before storage
    2. Decrypt fields when retrieving records
    3. Never expose raw PHI in logs or exceptions
    4. Validate access permissions before operations
    5. Maintain audit trails for all operations
