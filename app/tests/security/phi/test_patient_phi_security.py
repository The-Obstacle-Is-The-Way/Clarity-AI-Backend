HIPAA security tests for Patient PHI protection.

This module contains security-focused tests to verify HIPAA compliance
for Protected Health Information (PHI) in the patient model, including:
    - Encryption at rest
    - Secure logging (no PHI in logs)
    - Audit trail for PHI access
    - Secure error handling
