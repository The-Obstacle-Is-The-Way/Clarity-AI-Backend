"""
HIPAA Compliance Testing - ML PHI Security Tests

These tests validate that the ML processing components properly secure Protected Health Information (PHI)
according to HIPAA requirements. Tests here focus on proper de-identification, secure handling, and
isolation of PHI data in ML workflows.

Note: This file has been updated to work with the consolidated PHISanitizer implementation.
