## Recent Fixes

### Biometric Alert Endpoints

Recent improvements to the biometric alert rule endpoints have successfully addressed several issues:

1. **Fixed URL Path Issues**:
   - Removed duplicate path prefixes in the test endpoints
   - Fixed router configuration to prevent double-prefixing in URL paths

2. **Fixed Payload Format for Template-based Rule Creation**:
   - Resolved schema validation issues by correctly formatting template data
   - Updated UUID handling for template IDs
   - Fixed threshold value dictionary format

3. **Improved Test Assertion Logic**:
   - Enhanced mock assertions with more flexible validation
   - Fixed assert checking for customization fields

```

### 4. Other Tests (3 tests)

These tests are skipped for various other reasons:

```
SKIPPED [1] app/tests/security/api/test_api_hipaa_compliance.py:492: HTTPS enforcement tested at deployment level
SKIPPED [1] app/tests/security/api/test_api_hipaa_compliance.py:516: Rate limiting tested at infrastructure level

SKIPPED [1] app/tests/unit/services/ml/pat/test_pat_mock.py:492: Skipping test due to dynamically generated analysis IDs preventing exact error message validation
```

## Warning Categories

The 254 warnings in the test suite fall into several categories:

1. **Pydantic V2 Deprecation Warnings**: Use of deprecated methods like `.dict()` instead of `.model_dump()`
2. **Datetime Deprecation Warnings**: Use of `datetime.utcnow()` instead of `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`
3. **Test Event Loop Warnings**: Event loop fixture redefinition in multiple test files
4. **HTTPX Deprecation Warnings**: Use of deprecated `app` shortcut instead of explicit `ASGITransport`
5. **Asyncio Marking Inconsistencies**: Tests marked with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` but not implemented as async functions

## Next Steps

See [DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](./DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) for the strategic plan to address skipped tests and warnings.
