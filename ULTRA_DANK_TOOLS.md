## 🛡️ Security & Vulnerability Analysis

### Security Vulnerability Scanning
```bash
make security-scan          # Comprehensive scan with JSON reports
make security-scan-detailed  # Verbose output with explanations
```

**What it finds:**
- Code security vulnerabilities (Bandit)
- Dependency vulnerabilities (Safety)
- HIPAA compliance issues
- Weak cryptography usage
- SQL injection risks
- Pickle deserialization issues

**Sample Output:**
- **6 HIGH severity issues** - MD5 usage, unsafe PyTorch loading
- **14 MEDIUM severity issues** - Pickle usage, temp file issues
- **5,743 LOW severity issues** - Various code quality concerns

### Dead Code Detection
```bash
make dead-code  # Find unused code with 80% confidence threshold
```

**Capabilities:**
- Unused variables and imports
- Unreachable code paths
- Redundant function parameters
- Code quality issues
- Cleanup opportunities

**Current Findings:**
- **200+ unused variables** across the codebase
- **10+ unused imports** 
- **3 unreachable code blocks**

## ⚡ Performance Analysis

### Benchmarking Suite
```bash
make benchmark         # Run all performance benchmarks
make benchmark-compare # Compare with previous results
```

**Performance Results:**
| Function | Operations/Second | Performance |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Logger Creation | 2,814,019 | 🚀 Ultra Fast |
| UUID Generation | 431,335 | ⚡ Very Fast |
| JSON Processing | 4,412 | 💪 Fast |
| Password Hashing | 4.3 | 🔐 Secure (Intentionally Slow) |

### Memory Profiling
```bash
make memory-profile  # Profile memory usage of key functions
```

**Features:**
- Function-level memory analysis
- Memory leak detection
- Optimization opportunities

## 🔥 Load Testing

### API Load Testing with Locust
```bash
make load-test  # Start Locust web interface
```

**Testing Scenarios:**
- **Regular Users**: 1-3 second delays, realistic behavior
- **Admin Users**: 0.5-2 second delays, heavier operations  
- **High Volume Users**: 0.1-0.5 second delays, stress testing
- **Database Stress**: Simulated complex queries

**Web Interface:** http://localhost:8089
