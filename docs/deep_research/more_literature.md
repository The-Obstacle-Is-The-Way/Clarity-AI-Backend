# Psychiatric Digital Twin Systems – 2024–2025 Literature Review

## Executive Summary

Recent research into **psychiatric digital twin systems** shows a nascent but rapidly evolving field at the intersection of computational modeling, machine learning (ML), and mental health care. Since early 2024, a handful of conceptual frameworks and prototype studies have laid the groundwork for using *digital twins* – virtual patient replicas updated in real time – to improve mental health diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Key publications propose hybrid architectures that combine mechanistic models (e.g. differential equations or agent-based simulations of mental state dynamics) with data-driven ML components. These systems ingest multimodal patient data (Electronic Health Records, wearable sensor streams, self-reported questionnaires, therapy session transcripts, etc.) to continually personalize the twin’s state. The envisioned payoff is **precision mental health**: clinicians can forecast a patient’s deterioration, simulate “what-if” interventions (medications, therapy techniques) on the twin, and receive decision support for selecting optimal, personalized treatments.

However, **practical implementations** remain in early stages. To date, most psychiatric digital twin papers are *perspectives or methodological pieces* rather than clinical trial results. They outline system architectures and control methods but have not yet validated twins on large patient cohorts. For example, an opinion piece in *Frontiers in Psychiatry* demonstrated the concept via a therapist–patient “working alliance” model, but provided no real-world data evaluation. Similarly, engineering studies from 2024 introduce novel control algorithms (e.g. neural network controllers) to manage complex biomedical simulators, illustrating feasibility in silico but not applied to live psychiatric data. A 2024 scoping review in *npj Digital Medicine* confirms that health digital twins (DT4H) are still mostly pilot projects and conceptual frameworks, especially in mental health, which significantly lags fields like cardiology or oncology in DT adoption.

Key **technical opportunities** identified across these publications include: leveraging large language models (LLMs) to summarize unstructured patient data (e.g. therapy notes, social media) into the twin; implementing feedback control loops (from simple rule-based alerts to deep reinforcement learning controllers) to adapt interventions in real time; and using foundation models for sensor data (e.g. pre-trained models for speech or actigraphy signals) to translate raw behavioral data into clinically meaningful twin inputs. Notably, ensuring **trustworthiness** – through transparency of algorithms, “truthfulness” filters on AI-generated recommendations, and robust privacy safeguards – is repeatedly cited as a challenge.

In summary, the literature suggests that psychiatric digital twins hold great promise but are in an early phase. The next 90 days for Clarity AI’s development should focus on building a minimal viable twin platform that integrates multi-modal patient data streams, incorporates state-of-the-art ML pipelines (possibly via existing open-source tools), and lays the groundwork for clinical validation. Collaboration with academic consortia (e.g. digital health research networks) and careful attention to ethical guidelines will be crucial to accelerate progress while maintaining patient trust.

## Use-Case Clusters in Psychiatric Digital Twins

Contemporary efforts can be grouped by their primary **use-case in mental health**:

* **1. Diagnostic and Prognostic Aids:** Several works highlight using digital twins to improve **diagnosis** of mental disorders and **prognosis** of illness course. The envisioned twin continuously monitors an individual’s emotional and cognitive state and can issue alerts when detecting patterns of concern. For example, a twin might integrate passive smartphone sensor data (sleep, mobility), wearable vitals, and patient speech/text to flag early signs of depression relapse or impending manic episodes. Spitzer *et al.* note that a mental health DT could “forecast deterioration in mental health” and predict outcomes, enabling preventive interventions. In practice, this use-case overlaps with digital **phenotyping**: e.g. advanced NLP models can already classify mental health issues from text with high accuracy (one recent NLP pipeline detected trauma-related posts with >96% accuracy). Digital twins would take this further by combining **multiple data streams** per patient and maintaining an evolving risk profile. However, to date there are **no published clinical trials** of a psychiatric twin used as a diagnostic aid – current evidence comes from component technologies (like ML classifiers or risk scoring systems) rather than full twin systems. Early prototypes and proposals emphasize feasibility: for instance, Mokhtari’s framework suggests incorporating social media and cognitive assessments into the twin’s data intake to broaden the diagnostic picture. The main technical hurdle is data integration and validation: ensuring that a twin’s predictions (e.g. a suicide risk forecast) are accurate and actionable without excessive false alarms.

* **2. Treatment Personalization and Optimization:** This is the most frequently cited vision for psychiatric digital twins – using the twin as a *“virtual testbed”* to optimize therapy for an individual. In mental health, treatment personalization might mean selecting the antidepressant most likely to work for a specific patient, or tailoring psychotherapy techniques to a client’s profile. Digital twin architectures approach this via **simulation or predictive modeling**. Spitzer *et al.* describe an example where an *alliance-focused twin* could simulate different therapist responses to a rupture in the therapeutic alliance, to see which yields the best outcome for that patient. In pharmacotherapy, a twin might host a personalized model of the patient’s neurobiology or genomics; e.g., an ML model using that patient’s multi-omics data could predict drug response (similar to precision psychiatry studies that achieved AUC \~0.85 in predicting antidepressant response). The twin can then be used to **optimize treatment** via search or control algorithms – for example, Fonseca *et al.*’s work suggests using optimization on a learned patient model to find the best intervention plan. In engineering terms, this is a **control loop**: the twin forecasts outcomes for candidate treatments, and an algorithm recommends the intervention with maximal projected benefit (or minimal side effects). Some researchers have demonstrated the control loop concept on *analogous problems* like controlling an artificial pancreas or tuning chemotherapy doses, which can be translated into the psychiatric context. A critical challenge here is **validation** – these predictions must be tested in clinical settings. So far, published psychiatric twin papers have only theoretical or simulated validations (e.g. testing if the twin’s chosen “optimal” treatment would have matched retrospective outcomes, or using clinician judgment as a proxy). Over the next couple of years, we expect to see pilot studies where a twin recommends a treatment (e.g. choosing between SSRIs vs CBT for depression) and the outcomes are tracked prospectively. For now, the literature provides **frameworks**: hybrids of mechanistic understanding (e.g. disease models of PTSD) with data-driven personalization, all wrapped in a system that supports *counterfactual testing* (“If we increase therapy sessions from weekly to twice-weekly, does the twin show faster symptom improvement?”).

* **3. Relapse Prediction and Continuous Monitoring:** In chronic mental illnesses like recurrent depression, bipolar disorder, or PTSD, a key use-case is **relapse prevention**. Digital twins are posited to continuously mirror the patient’s mental state and issue early warnings for relapse, much like a cardiology twin might warn of impending cardiac decompensation. The twin can combine **baseline patient characteristics** with real-time data to detect subtle patterns: for instance, decreased social activity from smartphone data, combined with sleep disruption and negative sentiment in daily journals, might trigger the twin to predict a high probability of relapse into depression. This use-case overlaps with diagnosis but is more about longitudinal monitoring in between formal clinical visits. The *npj Digital Medicine* review noted that mental health digital twins often aim to “monitor mental health status, determine clinical diagnosis, and issue alarms when intervention is needed”. Implementation-wise, this requires robust **streaming data analysis** (potentially using edge computing for low latency as Mokhtari suggests) and thresholds or algorithms to decide when a change in the twin indicates a significant risk. A twin could also simulate the effect of upcoming stressors – e.g. what if a patient who is stable now faces a known trigger? Some frameworks propose that a twin might predict the impact of a future stress event (“test for a student or deployment for a soldier”) on the patient’s stability. The literature so far has described this conceptually; practically, it will involve a combination of anomaly detection, predictive modeling, and alerting mechanisms. One notable challenge is minimizing **false positives/negatives** – alert fatigue could occur if the twin over-predicts relapses, whereas missing an impending crisis could be dangerous. Thus, researchers emphasize the importance of model confidence and updating (the twin should learn from each false alarm or missed event to improve over time). In summary, relapse monitoring is a natural fit for digital twins but will require high-frequency data ingestion and carefully calibrated prediction models, many of which are still being developed under the banner of digital phenotyping rather than explicitly as “twins.”

It is worth noting that these use-cases are often served in **combination** within a single twin system. For example, a comprehensive psychiatric digital twin might simultaneously monitor for relapse (use-case 3), assist in refining the current treatment (use-case 2), and update the patient’s prognosis or diagnosis as new data arrives (use-case 1). The cluster distinctions help to map specific technical requirements to each function (e.g. continuous data streaming for monitoring vs. simulation capabilities for treatment testing).

## Technical Approaches vs. Clarity AI’s Design Needs

Clarity AI is developing a Python-based mental health digital twin backend, so it’s valuable to compare our design choices with those reported in the literature:

* **Data Modalities & Integration:** Published twin systems underscore the need to integrate **heterogeneous data** – from structured clinical data (EHR diagnoses, medications) to unstructured text (therapy notes, journals) and sensor data (wearable activity, smartphone use). Clarity AI’s backend plans (as evident from its data model) already reflect this, with components for psychological data, biometric streams, and behavioral logs. One gap to address is robust **data fusion**: academic frameworks suggest using knowledge graphs or common data models to combine these sources in the twin. In Clarity’s context, we may leverage open standards (e.g. FHIR for EHR, HL7) and APIs for wearables. Additionally, **real-time ingestion** is crucial – Mokhtari et al. advocate for edge computing when low latency is needed. While near-real-time may not be critical for all psychiatric scenarios, Clarity’s system should be designed to handle streaming data (e.g. daily mood scores, hourly step counts) and update the twin state promptly.

* **Modeling Techniques (Mechanistic vs. ML):** There’s a clear trend toward **hybrid modeling** in mental health twins. Traditional *physics-based* models (like ODEs of neurochemical levels or stress response) provide interpretability but often fail to capture the complexity of mental illnesses. Pure ML models (like black-box neural nets predicting mood) can fit data but may lack explanatory power and extrapolative reliability. The literature encourages combining the two: for example, a mechanistic model of a patient’s therapy progress can be continually calibrated with ML estimates of model parameters. Clarity AI’s design should similarly allow plug-in of both **theory-driven components** (e.g. a computational model of cognitive-behavioral therapy effect) and **data-driven predictors** (e.g. an LSTM forecasting mood swings). This modular approach aligns with Clean Architecture principles in Clarity’s code – the domain layer could host mechanistic models, and a service layer could invoke ML predictions. Furthermore, advanced techniques like **metamodeling** (Fonseca et al.’s approach) might be relevant: Clarity could maintain a lightweight surrogate model of each user’s state that is quick to simulate, wrapping a heavier underlying model. This surrogate can enable faster experimentation (e.g. simulate 100 possible interventions overnight to find the best plan). Adopting such techniques will require expertise in ML training and validation to ensure the surrogate remains accurate.

* **Control and Personalization Mechanisms:** The literature provides multiple strategies for the *twin’s control loop*. Böttcher et al. demonstrate the use of **artificial neural network controllers** to adjust model inputs and drive desired outcomes. In a psychiatric twin, a comparable idea could be using an ANN to decide therapy adjustments (for instance, scheduling an extra session when the twin’s trajectory worsens). Alternatively, simpler control schemes (rule-based or classic PID controllers) might suffice for certain parameters (e.g. maintaining medication dosage within a therapeutic window). Clarity AI should consider implementing a flexible **personalization engine**: perhaps a rule engine for straightforward decisions (if mood < X for 3 days, alert clinician), and an AI-driven planner for more complex optimization (like choosing an optimal intervention schedule). Importantly, given the **sensitivity in mental health**, any automated control should be constrained by clinician oversight (“human-in-the-loop”). This is echoed in research – authors acknowledge that AI recommendations must be transparent and clinician-verified, due to risks and ethical concerns. Therefore, Clarity’s system might incorporate a **recommendation ranking** rather than fully autonomous control: e.g. present top 3 personalized treatment suggestions to the provider, with explanations. From a technical standpoint, integrating an **optimization library** (such as Pyomo or an RL toolkit) could enable this feature. Clarity’s Python stack can leverage such libraries to implement, for example, a reinforcement learning agent that learns to recommend interventions based on reward signals (patient improvement as reward). Initially, this could be simulated using historical data to tune the agent.

* **NLP and LLM Integration:** A standout opportunity for Clarity AI is the use of **Large Language Models** and advanced NLP, which the academic literature only tangentially mentions. Our codebase already references *MentaLLaMA*, indicating an intent to use an LLM specialized for psychiatric text analysis. LLMs can serve *multiple roles*: summarizing long clinical histories into the twin’s state (an LLM could produce a concise “mental state report” from weekly therapy transcripts), extracting symptoms or sentiments from patient journals, and even generating plausible *what-if scenarios* (“simulate how the patient might respond if therapy is paused for two weeks”). While mainstream research hasn’t published on LLM-driven twins yet (likely due to how new LLM tech is), Clarity can be on the cutting edge here. We must implement **truthfulness and safety filters** around LLM outputs – e.g. using techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (having the LLM ground its summaries in actual patient data and known clinical facts) and moderation models to ensure no harmful advice is given. Incorporating an LLM API or an open-source model (like `mental-bert` or a fine-tuned GPT) into our pipeline will require careful design: it should operate as a contained module whose outputs are validated. The literature’s caution on “black-box” AI is very relevant; thus Clarity might also log and explain LLM decisions (perhaps by attaching references or extracting key evidence from text). Overall, bridging NLP into the twin will greatly enhance the twin’s understanding of patient context beyond raw numbers, something current academic prototypes haven’t fully realized.

* **Privacy, Security, and Ethics:** Every source we reviewed stresses these considerations, and they align with Clarity AI’s needs as a health platform. Twins by definition accumulate *sensitive longitudinal data*. The scoping review and perspectives suggest measures like **blockchain for data integrity** and stringent access controls. Clarity AI should implement state-of-the-art security (encryption in transit and at rest, rigorous authentication for any user accessing twin data). On the ethics side, maintaining an IRB-approved protocol for any research use, obtaining informed consent for using personal data in the twin, and providing transparency to the patient (e.g. a patient-facing summary of what the twin has inferred about them) are recommended. While these are not “engineering” features per se, they must be built into the design (for instance, the data schema could tag data with consent permissions, and the UI could have a transparency dashboard). Notably, Zilcha-Mano’s perspective highlights that mental health twins must incorporate psychology/behavioral science expertise – Clarity should ensure interdisciplinary input (maybe via an advisory board of clinicians) when designing how the twin interprets data and makes suggestions.

In summary, Clarity AI’s backend is conceptually on track with the literature: a modular, multi-modal system with AI analytics and feedback loops. The gaps to close are mainly in *implementation details* – choosing the right algorithms (e.g. ANN controller vs. simpler rules), ensuring system performance (scalability to many users and real-time responsiveness where needed), and adding innovative NLP capabilities. By aligning each planned feature with what has (and hasn’t) worked in research, we can accelerate development while avoiding known pitfalls (for example, over-reliance on opaque models without interpretability).

## Cross-Cutting Enablers and Innovations

Across the diverse studies, some **common enablers** emerge that are likely to accelerate psychiatric digital twin development in the near term. Clarity AI should leverage these cross-cutting technologies:

* **Foundation Models for Data Interpretation:** Whether it’s wearable sensor streams, audio recordings of patient speech, or free-form text, foundation models (pre-trained deep learning models) offer a jump-start to analyze these modalities. For instance, **transformer-based language models** can comprehend clinical notes or even patient journal entries far better than rule-based systems, extracting sentiments and warning signs. Similarly, pre-trained CNN or transformer models for time-series (e.g. activity recognition models) can turn raw accelerometer data into higher-level features (sleep quality, exercise patterns). By plugging in these models, a digital twin can have rich “senses.” The literature hints at this by referencing digital phenotyping and AI-driven analytics, but Clarity can go further by directly integrating open-source models (such as Google’s FitBit activity model or audio emotion classifiers). This reduces the need to reinvent feature extraction and lets us focus on the twin’s decision logic. It’s important, however, to validate that these models are tuned or calibrated to our population – e.g. an emotion detection model might need fine-tuning on clinical interview data to be effective for the twin’s purposes.

* **LLM Summarizers and Conversational Agents:** Large Language Models are not only useful for analysis, but also for **user interaction**. A psychiatric digital twin could include a conversational interface (a chatbot or companion app) that summarizes the twin’s findings for patients or clinicians. Imagine an AI assistant that tells the clinician: “The patient’s twin shows increasing social withdrawal and sleep disruption; risk of relapse is up by 20%. Key contributing factors: reduced exercise, negative tone in self-reports.” Crafting such summaries is exactly where LLMs excel. Moreover, the twin could interact with the patient through a chatbot, asking brief questions to fill data gaps (“How are you feeling compared to yesterday?”) and providing psychoeducation or recommendations under clinician-defined constraints. The MindBank Ai initiative, for example, uses an AI persona to engage users in self-reflection, which is an early form of this idea. Clarity AI should explore integrating an LLM-based coach or reporter that can translate the twin’s complex data into natural language. The **truthfulness filters** come into play here: we must ensure the LLM’s output sticks to the twin’s actual data and established clinical knowledge (for safety). Techniques like **knowledge distillation** (basing the LLM on a smaller interpretable model’s outputs) or **fact-checking pipelines** (verifying LLM statements against the database) can be employed. These will increase trust in any AI-driven communication.

* **Feedback Control Loops (Automation with a Human Touch):** A digital twin isn’t just a passive model; the concept shines when there’s a feedback loop adjusting patient care. Across studies, we see proposals for loops at different levels of autonomy – from fully automated (neural nets adjusting simulations) to semi-automated (twin suggests and human decides). An enabler for this is the maturation of **reinforcement learning (RL)** and control algorithms in healthcare. Libraries and frameworks now exist that can handle sequential decision-making under uncertainty, which is essentially what treatment planning is. For example, an RL agent could learn a policy for when to send an alert or how to titrate a medication in the twin to achieve stability. We also have **Bayesian optimization** methods that can work with smaller data (common in personal medicine) to fine-tune treatment parameters. Clarity AI can capitalize on these by integrating such algorithms once sufficient data is available. Initially, a safer strategy is to implement *closed-loop simulations*: let the twin model and control logic play out “virtual trials” and see if the outcomes align with known results. This kind of dry-run can validate the approach before real-world use. Additionally, ensuring **clinician-in-the-loop** enablers (like a dashboard to override or adjust AI suggestions) will be key. Technology like explainable AI toolkits can highlight why the twin’s controller is recommending a change, making it easier for the human operator to agree or veto.

* **Continuous Learning and Personalization Infrastructure:** One often overlooked enabler is the infrastructure for the twin to continuously learn from new data. In mental health, each individual’s trajectory can teach the model something new about that person (and sometimes about the broader population). The concept of an online-learning twin or a *self-updating twin* is floated in the literature. Realizing this requires a robust MLOps setup: automated data pipelines, model retraining triggers, validation monitors, etc. Modern cloud platforms and AutoML tools can assist – for example, setting up a scheduled retraining of the personalized model every week as new data accumulates, with performance checks to avoid drift. Clarity AI would benefit from designing the twin system with hooks for retraining/updating. This way, the twin doesn’t become stale or fixed to initial training data. Moreover, a global component (federated learning across twins, perhaps) could be considered: learning common patterns from multiple patients without pooling raw data (to maintain privacy). Frameworks for federated learning are an enabler that aligns well with privacy needs and could accelerate improvement of twin models by leveraging multi-patient insights.

In essence, these enablers – foundation AI models, LLMs, control algorithms, and continuous learning practices – are like **building blocks** that can dramatically enhance a psychiatric digital twin platform. The current literature acknowledges their importance in principle (especially AI/ML advances), but practical implementations are just beginning. Clarity AI has the advantage of building from scratch in 2025: we can incorporate these cutting-edge components from the ground up, rather than retrofitting an older system. This will position our platform at the forefront of precision mental health technology.

## 90-Day Action Roadmap for Clarity AI

Based on the literature review and our current development stage, here is a **90-day roadmap** outlining immediate actions and decisions for Clarity AI’s psychiatric digital twin project:

* **Kickoff a Pilot Study (Build & Collaborate):** In the next few weeks, initiate a small-scale pilot with either retrospective data or a limited live deployment. For example, **collaborate** with a local clinic or academic partner to obtain de-identified longitudinal data on, say, 20 patients with depression (including EHR data, weekly mood scales, possibly Fitbit data). This pilot will serve as a testbed for the twin. Prepare an IRB submission if needed for data use, addressing privacy and consent upfront (as emphasized by recent guidance). *Deliverable (Day 30):* dataset in place and data use agreements signed.

* **Implement Core Data Integration Pipeline (Build):** Develop the initial data ingestion and integration pipeline. This involves writing connectors for key data modalities: EHR (using FHIR APIs or CSV import), wearable data (e.g. utilizing Fitbit/Apple Health APIs), and patient-reported outcomes (through a simple survey app or file import). Use a unified data model for the twin state (following examples from literature, ensure fields for psychological, biometric, behavioral data are covered). *Deliverable (Day 45):* A running backend service that can pull in multi-modal data for a given patient ID and update the digital twin state object in our database.

* **Deploy an Initial ML Analytics Module (Build vs. Buy):** For one high-impact analytics task, decide whether to build in-house or integrate an existing solution. A good candidate is **text analysis of clinical notes or journals**. Given the availability of strong open-source models (e.g. a fine-tuned BERT for sentiment or a custom mental health NLP model), **buy/integrate** that rather than training from scratch. For instance, incorporate the *MentaLLaMA* model if ready, or use HuggingFace transformers to detect mood and key themes in text. Similarly, for wearable data, consider using open libraries (perhaps **buy** here means adopt open-source code) that calculate sleep metrics or activity levels. *Deliverable (Day 60):* An ML service that, given raw data (text or sensor), returns derived features (e.g. sentiment score, activity level) which feed into the twin. This service can be rudimentary but should be containerized and part of the pipeline.

* **Prototype a Personalization/Control Loop (Build):** Implement a simplified version of the twin’s decision-support loop. For example, choose one scenario – say, predicting the risk of relapse – and implement a rule-based or ML-based logic that triggers an alert or recommendation. This could be as simple as: “if PHQ-9 depression score increases by X and sleep drops below Y, flag high relapse risk.” Use insights from literature (like combining multiple signals for accuracy). In parallel, if resources allow, experiment with a more advanced approach on historical data: train a logistic regression or small neural net to predict next-month relapse using current twin state, then set a threshold for alerts. *Deliverable (Day 70):* An operational risk scoring function within the twin service, with documented rationale and initial performance evaluation on historical/pilot data (e.g. achieved 80% sensitivity for detecting past relapses – even if not perfect, it’s a baseline).

* **Incorporate LLM Summaries with Safeguards (Build & Evaluate):** Integrate an LLM-based summarizer for the twin. Using OpenAI’s API or an open model, create a function that generates a weekly summary of a patient’s status from the twin’s data (e.g. “Patient is showing moderate improvement, sleep is stable, but social interaction is down.”). Implement **truthfulness checks** by constraining the prompt to include actual data points and perhaps using a template. Also, put a **review step** – these summaries should be reviewed by a clinician on the team to ensure they are accurate and helpful. *Deliverable (Day 75):* A component in the backend that produces a natural-language summary from a digital twin state, accessible via an endpoint (and a couple of example outputs vetted for correctness). This will showcase our use of cutting-edge LLM tech as suggested in cross-cutting enablers.

* **Conduct an Interdisciplinary Design Review (Collaborate):** Before finalizing the quarter’s work, hold a review session with key stakeholders – e.g. a clinical psychologist, a data privacy officer, and an ML researcher (could be advisors or collaborators). Present the pilot results, pipeline, and prototype features. Solicit feedback specifically on usability (will clinicians find the outputs useful?), ethical considerations, and technical gaps. The literature highlights the importance of clinician trust and ethical guardrails – use this review to preempt issues. *Deliverable (Day 85):* A short report or meeting minutes capturing expert feedback and listing any adjustments (e.g. “need to improve interpretability of risk model” or “ensure patients can opt out of certain data collection”).

* **Refine and Document (Build):** In the final stretch, refine the components built so far. Improve error handling, data quality checks (per Mokhtari’s note on data fidelity), and ensure security measures are in place for the pilot (encrypt sensitive fields, audit logging). Also, prepare documentation: an **updated architecture diagram** showing how data flows through the twin system (from input APIs to storage to analysis to output). Include how each cross-cutting technology is incorporated. *Deliverable (Day 90):* A v0.1 **Digital Twin System** running on a staging server, demonstrated with test data from the pilot, and a documentation pack for internal use (architecture docs, setup guide, and a brief report aligning our system with literature best practices and identifying next steps).

* **Decision Point – Expand, Purchase, or Partner:** As we conclude 90 days, use the insights gained to make strategic decisions. For instance: if our pilot shows promising predictive power, plan to **expand** to more users or a longer study; if we found that an external platform (say, a specific wearable analytics service or an open-source project from a consortium) could significantly accelerate development, propose to **“buy” or integrate** it (e.g. license a mental health dataset or join an initiative like the Digital Twin for Health consortium). If academic groups are actively researching this (like the Haifa University group or the Laubenbacher lab), consider a **collaboration** where we can validate our twin in parallel with their research. Essentially, decide the next quarter’s emphasis: building in-house vs. integrating vs. research partnerships, based on what yielded the best ROI so far. *Deliverable:* A short roadmap 2.0 proposal informed by real pilot outcomes and the literature landscape (this would be presented to stakeholders for approval of the next phase).

By following this roadmap, Clarity AI will ground its development in the concrete findings of recent research while also pushing into new territory (like practical LLM integration). The result after 90 days should be a functional early-version psychiatric digital twin platform – one that can be iteratively improved – and a clear direction on how to achieve a clinically validated, scalable system in subsequent phases. Each step ties back to known gaps or opportunities identified in the literature: for example, starting small addresses the current lack of clinical validation, using existing ML models addresses known technical challenges, and engaging clinicians ensures we don’t fall into the common trap of low user-trust in AI systems. This sets us up to truly realize the promise that recent papers have articulated: a reproducible, data-driven, patient-specific simulation system that can augment mental health care in the real world.
