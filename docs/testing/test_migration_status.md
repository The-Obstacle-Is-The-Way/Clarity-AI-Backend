# Standalone Test Migration Status

## Overview

This document tracks the migration progress of standalone tests to proper unit and integration tests.

## Migration Progress

| Domain | Total Tests | Migrated | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------|-------|
| Biometric Processing | 21 | 11 | ✅ In Progress | First batch successfully migrated. Some tests couldn't be migrated due to API differences. |
| Patient | 0 | 0 | ⏳ Not Started | |
| Digital Twin | 0 | 0 | ⏳ Not Started | |
| Security | 0 | 0 | ⏳ Not Started | |
| API Endpoints | 0 | 0 | ⏳ Not Started | |
| Infrastructure | 0 | 0 | ⏳ Not Started | |

## Recently Completed Migrations

### Biometric Processing (2023-06-19)

- Migrated test_biometric_processor.py to use actual implementation instead of duplicate code
- Added proper fixtures and setup for biometric data points
- Adjusted assertions to match actual implementation behavior

## Current Focus

- **Next Target**: Digital Twin standalone tests
- **Blocker Issues**: None identified

## Process Reminders

1. Use the migration script: `./scripts/migrate_standalone_tests.sh --create-template PATH_TO_STANDALONE_TEST`
2. Update imports in the generated template
3. Adjust test fixtures and assertions to match the actual implementation
4. Run tests to verify proper migration
5. Update this status document with progress

## Migration Decisions

- **Enhanced Tests**: Some standalone tests had more comprehensive test coverage than existing unit tests. In these cases, we're preserving the additional test cases during migration.
- **Differing APIs**: When the standalone implementation differs significantly from the actual implementation, we're adapting the tests to the actual implementation while preserving test intent.
- **PHI Handling**: Special attention is given to ensure all tests properly handle PHI according to HIPAA requirements.
