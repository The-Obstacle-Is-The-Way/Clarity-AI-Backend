# Password Handler Interface

## Overview

The Password Handler Interface is a cornerstone of the Clarity AI Backend's security architecture, providing a clean abstraction for password hashing, verification, and security policy enforcement. This document outlines the design, implementation patterns, and security considerations for the password handling system according to clean architecture principles.

## Architectural Significance

In a healthcare-focused digital twin platform with HIPAA requirements, secure password management is critical. The `IPasswordHandler` interface represents a core security boundary that:

1. **Isolates Cryptographic Logic**: Keeps password hashing implementations separate from business logic
2. **Enables Security Updates**: Allows cryptographic algorithms to be upgraded without affecting other system components
3. **Enforces Consistent Security**: Provides a central implementation of password security policies
4. **Facilitates Testing**: Makes it possible to test authentication flows without cryptographic complexity

## Interface Definition

The `IPasswordHandler` interface is defined in the core layer (`app/core/interfaces/security/password_handler_interface.py`) and serves as a contract for password operations:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Dict, Tuple, Optional

class IPasswordHandler(ABC):
    """Interface for password handling operations.
    
    This interface defines the contract that any password handler implementation
    must follow. It provides methods for password hashing, verification, and 
    strength validation to ensure security best practices across the application.
    """
    
    @abstractmethod
    def hash_password(self, password: str) -> str:
        """Hash a password securely.
        
        Args:
            password: The plain text password to hash
            
        Returns:
            str: The securely hashed password
        """
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def verify_password(self, plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
        """Verify a password against its hash.

            bool: True if the password matches, False otherwise

            Tuple[bool, str]: A tuple containing:
                - A boolean indicating if the password meets strength requirements

                            suggestions for improvement, and other metrics
        """
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def is_common_password(self, password: str) -> bool:
        """Check if a password is in a list of commonly used/breached passwords.
        
        Args:
            password: The password to check
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if the password is common/breached, False otherwise
        """
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_secure_password(self, length: int = 16) -> str:
        """Generate a cryptographically secure random password.
        
        Args:

        Returns:
            str: A secure random password
        """
        pass
```

## Implementation Classes

### Standard Implementation

The concrete implementation of the password handling functionality is provided by `PasswordHandler` class in the infrastructure layer (`app/infrastructure/security/password/password_handler.py`). This implementation uses `passlib` with bcrypt for secure password hashing:

```python
class PasswordHandler:
    """
    Handles password hashing and verification using passlib.
    Allows configuration of hashing schemes and parameters.
    """

    def __init__(self, schemes: list[str] | None = None, deprecated: str = "auto"):
        """Initialize the PasswordHandler with specified schemes."""
        settings = get_settings()
        
        # Use schemes from settings if not provided, default to bcrypt if settings are missing
        default_schemes = ["bcrypt"]
        self.schemes = schemes or getattr(settings, 'PASSWORD_HASHING_SCHEMES', default_schemes)
        self.deprecated = deprecated
        
        try:
            self.context = CryptContext(schemes=self.schemes, deprecated=self.deprecated)
        except Exception as e:
            # Fallback to default context if initialization fails
            self.context = CryptContext(schemes=default_schemes, deprecated=deprecated)
            self.schemes = default_schemes

    def get_password_hash(self, password: str) -> str:
        """Hashes a plain text password."""
        try:
            return self.context.hash(password)
        except Exception as e:
            raise ValueError("Password hashing failed.") from e

    def verify_password(self, plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
        """Verifies a plain text password against a hashed password."""
        try:
            return self.context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)
        except Exception as e:
            return False

    def password_needs_rehash(self, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
        """Check if a password hash needs to be upgraded."""
        return self.context.needs_update(hashed_password)

    def generate_secure_password(self, length: int = 16) -> str:
        """Generate a cryptographically secure random password."""
        # Implementation ensures minimum length, character variety, and proper randomization
        # [Implementation details omitted for brevity]
        return password_str

    # Legacy aliases for backward compatibility
    def hash_password(self, password: str) -> str:
        """Alias for get_password_hash (retained for backwards‑compat)."""
        return self.get_password_hash(password)

    def check_password(self, plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
        """Alias for verify_password (retained for backwards‑compat)."""
        return self.verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password)

    def validate_password_strength(self, password: str) -> tuple[bool, str | None]:
        """Validate password strength against HIPAA-compliant security requirements."""
        # Implementation checks for:
        # - Complexity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special chars)
        # - Minimum length (12 characters)
        # - Common patterns
        # - Repeating characters
        # - Uses zxcvbn for additional strength assessment
        # [Implementation details omitted for brevity]
        return True, None

    # Additional methods for password validation and improvement suggestions...
```

In addition, standalone utility functions are provided in `app/infrastructure/security/password/hashing.py`:

```python
# Define the password context using bcrypt
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

def verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
    """Verify a plaintext password against a hashed password."""
    # Handle None values gracefully
    if plain_password is None or hashed_password is None:
        return False
    
    try:
        return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)
    except Exception:
        return False

def get_password_hash(password: str) -> str:
    """Hash a plaintext password using passlib context (bcrypt)."""
    return pwd_context.hash(password)
```

### Testing Implementation

For testing purposes, a simplified implementation is used in test suites that provides deterministic behavior:

```python
class MockPasswordHandler(IPasswordHandler):
    """
    Simplified password handler implementation for testing.
    
    This implementation provides deterministic behavior for unit tests
    without cryptographic overhead or external dependencies.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, always_valid: bool = True):
        self._always_valid = always_valid
    
    def hash_password(self, password: str) -> str:
        return f"mocked_hash:{password}" 
    
    def verify_password(self, plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
        if self._always_valid:
            return True
        expected = f"mocked_hash:{plain_password}"
        return hashed_password == expected
    
    def validate_password_strength(self, password: str) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[str]]:
        if self._always_valid:
            return True, None
        if len(password) < 8:
            return False, "Password too short"
        return True, None
    
    # Mock implementations of other required methods...
```

## Clean Architecture Compliance

The Password Handler implementation adheres to Clean Architecture principles in the following ways:

### 1. Dependency Rule Compliance

- **Core Definition**: The `IPasswordHandler` interface is defined in the core layer (`app/core/interfaces/security`).
- **Implementation in Infrastructure**: Concrete implementations reside in the infrastructure layer (`app/infrastructure/security/password`).
- **Direction of Dependencies**: The application layer depends on the interface, not on concrete implementations.

### 2. Separation of Concerns

- **Cryptographic Boundary**: All password hashing complexity is contained within specialized implementations.
- **Policy Separation**: Security policies are centralized and configurable.
- **No Domain Leakage**: Domain entities have no knowledge of how password security is implemented.

### 3. Testability

- **Interface-Based Testing**: Application services can be tested with mock implementations.
- **Security Verifiability**: Actual implementation can be separately tested for cryptographic correctness.

### 4. Configuration Adherence

- **Settings Injection**: Security parameters are provided through settings injection rather than hardcoded values.
- **Centralized Security Config**: All security policies are defined in the application settings.

## HIPAA Security Considerations

The Password Handler implementation meets HIPAA security requirements in the following ways:

### Authentication Requirements (§164.312(d))

- **Secure Algorithm**: Uses bcrypt, a cryptographically strong algorithm with automatic salting
- **Password Complexity**: Enforces configurable complexity requirements:
  - Minimum length (12 characters)
  - Mixed case (uppercase and lowercase letters)
  - Numeric and special characters
- **Brute Force Protection**: Configurable hash rounds parameter to adjust computational cost
- **No Password Retrieval**: Passwords are one-way hashed and never retrievable

### Automatic Logoff (§164.312(a)(2)(iii))

- **Session Management**: Works in conjunction with JWT token expiration
- **Re-authentication**: Expired sessions require re-entering credentials

### Audit Controls (§164.312(b))

- **Failed Attempt Tracking**: Works with the audit logging subsystem to record authentication failures
- **Policy Compliance Monitoring**: Allows auditing of password policy adherence

## Implementation Status

### Current Status

- ✅ Core interface defined and located in correct layer (`app/core/interfaces/security`)
- ⚠️ **Implementation Discrepancy**: The actual `PasswordHandler` class does not formally implement the `IPasswordHandler` interface, though it provides similar functionality
- ✅ Primary implementation using bcrypt complete through `passlib`
- ✅ Integration with user authentication service
- ✅ Test implementation available with dedicated test suite
- ✅ HIPAA-compliant password policies enforced
- ⚠️ **Dual Implementation**: Both a class-based implementation and standalone functions exist, potentially causing confusion

### Architectural Gaps

- 🔄 The concrete implementation should implement the interface explicitly
- 🔄 Consolidate the dual implementation (standalone functions vs. class-based)
- 🔄 Consider implementing password history tracking to prevent reuse
- 🔄 Add adaptive cost factor adjustment based on hardware capabilities
- 🔄 Implement optional two-factor authentication support

### Method Alignment Issues

- ⚠️ Interface method `get_password_strength_feedback` lacks a proper implementation
- ⚠️ Interface method `is_common_password` is not fully implemented (current implementation only checks against a small hardcoded list)
- ⚠️ Implementation provides methods not in the interface (`password_needs_rehash`, `check_password_breach`, `suggest_password_improvement`)

## Dependency Injection

The Password Handler can be provided through FastAPI's dependency injection system:

```python
from fastapi import Depends
from app.core.interfaces.security.password_handler_interface import IPasswordHandler
from app.infrastructure.security.password.password_handler import PasswordHandler
from app.core.config.settings import get_settings

async def get_password_handler() -> PasswordHandler:
    """
    Dependency provider for Password Handler.
    
    Returns:
        PasswordHandler implementation
    """
    settings = get_settings()
    return PasswordHandler()
```

## Usage in Authentication Flow

The Password Handler is used throughout the authentication system for user registration, authentication, and password management operations.

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite exists in `app/tests/unit/infrastructure/security/test_password_handler.py` that verifies:

- Password hashing security
- Password verification
- Password strength validation
- Secure random password generation

## Migration Strategy

To align the implementation with the interface, the following steps are recommended:

1. Update the `PasswordHandler` class to explicitly implement the `IPasswordHandler` interface
2. Consolidate the standalone hashing functions with the class implementation
3. Complete implementation of all interface methods
4. Standardize method naming and signature conventions between interface and implementation

## Security Considerations

The password handler implements several security best practices:

1. **Salt Generation**: Each password hash includes a unique salt
2. **Work Factor**: Configurable work factor to balance security and performance
3. **Timing Attacks**: Uses constant-time comparison for verification
4. **Hash Upgrades**: Supports detecting and upgrading outdated hash algorithms
5. **Secure Random Generation**: Uses cryptographically secure random generators
6. **Advanced Strength Checking**: Uses zxcvbn for sophisticated password strength evaluation

## Conclusion

The Password Handler Interface is a foundational security component for the Clarity AI Backend that ensures consistent and secure handling of passwords throughout the application. While the current implementation provides strong security features, addressing the identified alignment gaps would improve architectural consistency and maintainability in accordance with clean architecture principles.
