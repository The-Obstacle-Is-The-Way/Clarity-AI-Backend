## Contributing Guidelines

When contributing to the Novamind platform codebase, it is essential to maintain
documentation alongside code changes. For any changes to the system:

1. Update relevant documentation files to reflect new architectural decisions, API
   changes, or process modifications
2. Ensure that all documentation follows the established formats and standards
3. Keep the Digital Twin documents up-to-date with any changes to the machine learning
   models or algorithms
4. Follow the API Guidelines when documenting new endpoints or modifying existing ones

## Documentation Standards

- All documentation should be in Markdown format
- Include diagrams where appropriate (using PlantUML or Mermaid)
- Code examples should be provided for all API endpoints
- Security and privacy considerations must be documented for all data flows
- Each document should include a "Last Updated" date
