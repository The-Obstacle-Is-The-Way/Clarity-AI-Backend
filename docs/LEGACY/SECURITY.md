# HIPAA Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the HIPAA-compliant security architecture of the Clarity AI Backend system, designed to protect Protected Health Information (PHI) throughout the application lifecycle.

## Security Components

#### MLEncryptionService
Extended encryption support for machine learning data:

- **Features**:
  - Tensor/embedding encryption with shape preservation
  - Model state dictionary encryption
  - Secure model file encryption and decryption
  - PHI detection for ML inference inputs
  - Backward compatibility with previous versions

#### Field-level Encryption
Granular field-level encryption for domain model fields:

- **Features**:
  - Transparent field encryption/decryption
  - Preserves data types and formats
  - Integration with value objects for domain model security

### PHI Protection

#### PHISanitizer
Comprehensive PHI redaction system:

- **Features**:
  - Pattern-based PHI detection
  - Configurable whitelist patterns
  - Path-specific PHI handling rules
  - Contextual redaction (preserves non-PHI parts)

#### Safe Logging
PHI-safe logging implementation:

  - Automatic redaction of PHI in logs
  - Customizable redaction patterns
  - Integration with standard Python logging
  - Audit trail capabilities

#### API Security
API endpoint protection:

- **Features**:
  - No PHI in URLs
  - Path parameter validation
  - Query parameter sanitization
  - Response sanitization

### Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT Security
Secure token-based authentication:

- **Features**:
  - Short-lived JWT tokens with secure signing
  - Refresh token mechanism
  - Role-based claims
  - Automatic token invalidation

#### RBAC System
Fine-grained role-based access control:

- **Features**:
  - Hierarchical role system
  - Permission-based access control
  - Context-aware authorization
  - Resource-level permissions

## Security Best Practices

### Key Management
- Encryption keys stored in environment variables or secure vaults
- Key rotation capabilities for periodic security renewal
- Key length validation and normalization

### Error Handling
- No PHI in error messages or logs
- Sanitized stack traces
- Generic error messages to users

### Input Validation
- All inputs validated with Pydantic
- Strict type checking
- Pattern validation for sensitive fields

### Network Security
- TLS for all connections
- Rate limiting
- IP-based blocking for suspicious activity

## Value Object Security Example: ContactInfo

The `ContactInfo` value object demonstrates comprehensive PHI protection:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ContactInfo:
    """Value object for patient contact information with HIPAA-compliant PHI protection."""
    
    email: Optional[str] = None
    phone: Optional[str] = None
    preferred_contact_method: Optional[str] = None
    _is_encrypted: bool = False
    
    # Methods for field-level encryption
    def encrypt(self) -> 'ContactInfo':
        """Create an encrypted version of this ContactInfo."""
        # Implementation encrypts each field and returns new instance
    
    def decrypt(self) -> 'ContactInfo':
        """Create a decrypted version of this ContactInfo."""
        # Implementation decrypts each field and returns new instance
```

## ML Data Security Example

ML models and data are protected with specialized encryption:

```python
def encrypt_ml_data(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Encrypt ML-specific data, handling tensors and PHI appropriately."""
    # Implementation encrypts tensors and PHI fields differently
    
def decrypt_ml_data(self, encrypted_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Decrypt ML-specific data, handling tensors and PHI appropriately."""
    # Implementation restores original data format
```

## Security Maintenance

### Testing
- Comprehensive security test suite
- Encryption consistency tests
- Key rotation tests
- PHI detection tests

### Compliance Monitoring
- Automated logging scans for PHI leaks
- Regular security audits
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning
