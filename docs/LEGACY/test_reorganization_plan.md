# Integration Tests Reorganization Plan

## âœ… Phase 1: Directory Structure Cleanup (Completed)

1. Created a clear v1-based structure for API tests
2. Moved existing tests to their proper locations
3. Removed duplicate/redundant test files
4. Added proper README documentation
5. Fixed import errors causing test collection failures

## Phase 2: Further Improvements (Next Steps)

1. **Fix Remaining Test Failures:**
   - Authentication middleware tests
   - PHI validation in XGBoost endpoint
   - DB PHI protection tests
   - PAT mock service tests

2. **Standardize Test Patterns:**
   - Convert all tests to use dependency injection
   - Implement proper HIPAA-compliant fixture data
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Add proper docstrings to all test classes and methods

3. **Implement Missing Test Coverage:**
   - Add comprehensive test coverage for all API endpoints
   - Add proper security tests (HIPAA, authentication, authorization)
   - Add performance tests for critical paths

## Phase 3: CI/CD Integration

1. Add GitHub Actions workflow for test automation
2. Implement test coverage reporting
3. Add performance benchmarking
4. Set up quality gates based on test results

## Clean Architecture Principles for Tests

1. **Domain Layer Tests:**
   - Test domain entities in isolation
   - Validate business rules and invariants

2. **Application Layer Tests:**
   - Test use cases with mocked repositories
   - Validate business logic flows

3. **Infrastructure Layer Tests:**
   - Test repositories with real database
   - Test external service adapters

4. **API Layer Tests:**
   - Test endpoints with mocked services
   - Validate request/response formats
   - Test authentication and authorization

## HIPAA Compliance in Tests

1. **PHI Protection:**
   - No real PHI in test data
   - All test data should be properly sanitized
   - Encryption services should handle PHI correctly

2. **Audit Logging:**
   - Tests should validate that PHI access is properly logged
   - Tests should validate that authentication attempts are logged

3. **Authorization:**
   - Tests should validate that users can only access data they are authorized to see

## Integration with Digital Twin

1. **Data Flow:**
   - Tests should validate proper data flow between components
   - Tests should validate digital twin update mechanisms

2. **Analytics:**
   - Tests should validate that analytics pipelines work correctly
   - Tests should validate that ML models can be properly retrained
