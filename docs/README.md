## Documentation Standards

All documentation follows the standards defined in the [Style Guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md) and adheres to the [Naming Conventions](./NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md). Contributors should familiarize themselves with these documents before making changes.

Our documentation standards include:

1. **Truth-Seeking**: All documentation must be accurate and avoid unsubstantiated claims
2. **HIPAA Compliance**: Documentation must adhere to HIPAA guidelines for patient data
3. **Clean Architecture**: Documentation reflects the clean architecture of the codebase
4. **Consistency**: Documentation follows consistent styling and naming conventions
5. **Completeness**: Documentation covers all aspects of the system

## Templates

Documentation templates are available in the [templates](./templates) directory for creating consistent documentation:

- [API Endpoint Template](./templates/API_ENDPOINT_TEMPLATE.md)
- [Architecture Component Template](./templates/ARCHITECTURE_COMPONENT_TEMPLATE.md)
- [README Template](./templates/README_TEMPLATE.md)
- [Domain Entity Template](./templates/DOMAIN_ENTITY_TEMPLATE.md)

## Documentation Tools

The project uses several tools to maintain documentation quality:

- **MkDocs with Material theme**: Static site generation for documentation
- **Vale**: Prose linting for style enforcement
- **Markdownlint**: Markdown syntax linting
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated checks before commits

## Recent Updates

1. **README.md Overhaul**:
   - Removed unsubstantiated statistical claims
   - Updated project description with accurate capabilities
   - Fixed broken links
   - Updated badges
   - Ensured architecture references are accurate

2. **CONTRIBUTING.md Creation**:
   - Added comprehensive contribution guidelines
   - Included code style requirements
   - Documented the PR process
   - Added documentation guidelines

3. **Vale Configuration**:
   - Implemented prose linting with Vale
   - Created custom style rules for HIPAA compliance
   - Established vocabulary management
   - Set up Vale integration with pre-commit hooks

4. **Documentation Structure**:

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation Integration**: Ensure all codebase components have corresponding documentation
2. **Automated Checks**: Implement CI/CD checks for documentation quality
3. **Documentation Coverage**: Monitor and improve documentation coverage
4. **User Feedback**: Collect and incorporate user feedback on documentation clarity
5. **Maintenance Plan**: Establish regular documentation review and update schedule
