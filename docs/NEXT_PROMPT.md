# Next Prompt for Clarity AI Backend

## Summary of Completed Changes (Analytics Module Iteration)

In this iteration, we focused on fixing critical issues in the Analytics module, improving code quality, and ensuring HIPAA compliance:

1. **Fixed SQLAlchemy Relationship Issues**
   - Established proper bidirectional relationship between `User` and `AnalyticsEventModel`
   - Configured lazy loading strategy with `selectin` for optimal performance
   - Added proper cascading behavior for delete operations

2. **Fixed Timezone Handling for HIPAA Compliance**
   - Replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with timezone-aware `datetime.now(UTC)` in analytics module
   - Updated timezone handling in biometric rules and alert templates
   - Ensured consistent timestamp handling for audit logs and event tracking

3. **Improved Test Structure**
   - Updated mock objects to properly use MagicMock with AsyncMock
   - Fixed HTTP client tests to use ASGITransport pattern
   - Improved caching test behavior to properly handle cached objects
   - Updated test fixtures to work with actual implementations

4. **Fixed Authentication in Tests**
   - Added option to skip authentication middleware in tests
   - Properly mocked authentication dependencies

5. **Eliminated Warnings**
   - Fixed deprecation warnings for datetime usage
   - Eliminated timezone-related problems

## Next Priority Areas (Vertical Slices)

For the next iteration, we should focus on one of these critical areas:

### Option 1: JWT Authentication and Security Module
- Fix remaining JWT implementation to use timezone-aware datetime
- Update token creation and validation to follow HIPAA best practices
- Implement automatic token refresh mechanism
- Add comprehensive activity logging for authentication events

### Option 2: PHI Sanitization in API Responses
- Implement consistent PHI sanitization across all endpoints
- Update API models to enforce HIPAA compliance
- Add PHI detection and sanitization middleware
- Fix skipped tests in the PHI sanitization modules

### Option 3: Patient/User Repository Layer
- Standardize repository patterns following SOLID principles
- Ensure consistent error handling and logging
- Complete test coverage for repository operations
- Update cascading relationship behaviors

## Recommendation

I recommend proceeding with Option 1 (JWT Authentication) as this is foundational for HIPAA compliance and secures the entire API surface. The security layer impacts all areas of the application and fixes here will benefit all endpoints.
