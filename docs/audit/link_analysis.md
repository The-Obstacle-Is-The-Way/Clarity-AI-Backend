## Documentation Cross-References

Several documentation files reference each other, and we need to verify each of these links. Based on initial examination, we've found:

1. The API Reference documentation references endpoints that may not match the actual implementation
2. Architecture documentation may not accurately reflect the current codebase structure
3. Project Structure documentation contains directory paths that don't match the actual codebase

## Code Structure vs. Documentation

Based on examining the actual codebase structure, we've identified these mismatches:

1. The Project_Structure.md file describes a structure that doesn't match the actual layout:
   - Documentation mentions `app/domain/` but code uses both `app/domain/` and `app/core/domain/`
   - Documentation mentions `app/application/` but code may use different paths for application logic
   - Actual structure includes additional directories not documented

2. The API_Reference.md describes endpoints that may not match actual implementations:
   - Some listed endpoints might be partially implemented or just have route definitions
   - Some implemented endpoints may be missing from documentation
   - Status indicators may be inaccurate (e.g., marking as "implemented" when only placeholder exists)

3. Architecture documentation may not reflect actual implementation:
   - Clean architecture boundaries may have shifted during refactoring
   - Some interfaces might have been moved or renamed
   - New architectural patterns may be in use but undocumented

## Recommendations

1. Update all documentation to reflect the current codebase structure
2. Create missing files (especially CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. Fix broken links and badge references
4. Add documentation for any undocumented components
5. Update API reference to accurately reflect implemented endpoints
6. Generate current architecture diagrams from the actual codebase
