# JWT and Authentication Middleware Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **JWT Token Validation Issues**
   - Inconsistent error handling for expired tokens
   - Incorrectly handling malformed tokens
   - Token type validation issues in refresh tokens
   - Issuer validation issues

2. **Authentication Middleware Problems**
   - Middleware not properly skipped in test environments
   - Incorrect token handling in tests

## Changes Made

### Core Token Implementation 

1. **Improved the JWT Service (`app/infrastructure/security/jwt/jwt_service.py`)**
   - Standardized error messages and handling
   - Fixed token expiration detection and exception handling
   - Added proper validation for token types in refresh tokens
   - Improved handling of malformed tokens with consistent error messages
   - Enhanced issuer validation

2. **Improved Testing**
   - Fixed the mock JWT service to properly mimic real service behavior
   - Updated test fixtures to correctly handle token payloads
   - Adjusted test case assertions for variable token expiration times

### Authentication Middleware

1. **Fixed Application Factory (`app/factory.py`)**
   - Made the `skip_auth_middleware` flag actually work
   - Added proper state handling for application middleware configuration
   - Added logging to explain when middleware is skipped

2. **Fixed Client Test Fixtures**
   - Updated fixtures to properly mock token generation and validation
   - Fixed path parameter handling in test endpoints

## Results

1. **Test Passes**
   - All JWT service unit tests now pass (39 tests)
   - All JWT security tests now pass (14 tests)
   - Authentication endpoint tests all pass (6 tests)
   - Patient endpoint tests all pass (5 tests)

2. **Improved Security**
   - Consistent token validation across the application
   - Better error messages for token issues
   - More reliable token expiration handling

3. **Better Test Environment**
   - Tests can now properly skip authentication middleware when needed
   - JWT service mocks correctly mimic production behavior

## Remaining Issues

1. **Analytics and Digital Twins Tests**
   - Several tests still fail due to unrelated schema validation issues
   - These are separate from the JWT and authentication issues fixed here

2. **Deprecation Warnings**
   - Several deprecation warnings remain from the `jose` library using `datetime.utcnow()`
   - Could be addressed in a future update
