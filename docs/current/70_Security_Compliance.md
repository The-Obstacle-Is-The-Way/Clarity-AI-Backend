# 70. Security & HIPAA Compliance Guide

This document outlines the security principles, practices, and HIPAA compliance measures implemented within the Novamind Digital Twin platform's backend.

## 1. Commitment to HIPAA Compliance

The platform is designed and operated with strict adherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations. Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI) is paramount.

## 2. Key Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls are employed.
- **Least Privilege**: Users and system components have only the minimum necessary permissions.
- **Secure Defaults**: Configurations prioritize security out-of-the-box.
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary PHI is collected, processed, and stored.
- **Regular Audits**: Security posture and compliance are reviewed regularly.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

- **Authentication**: User and service authentication likely relies on industry standards like OAuth2 with JWT tokens. Specific implementation details (e.g., token endpoint, refresh tokens) should be referenced here [Link to specific Auth module/docs if available].
- **Authorization**: Access control is enforced at the API layer, typically using FastAPI dependencies. Role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) principles should be applied to ensure users can only access data and functionality permitted by their roles/permissions.
- **Service Accounts**: Machine-to-machine communication should use secure service account credentials (e.g., API keys, client credentials flow).

## 4. Data Encryption

- **Encryption in Transit**: All external communication must use HTTPS/TLS (TLS 1.2 or higher). API endpoints are served exclusively over HTTPS.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data, particularly PHI stored in the database, must be encrypted at rest using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256). This is typically handled at the database infrastructure level (e.g., PostgreSQL encryption features) or via application-level encryption if required [Verify specific implementation].

## 5. PHI Handling & Protection

- **No PHI in URLs**: API endpoints and query parameters must **never** contain PHI.
- **Logging**: Logs must **never** contain PHI. Sensitive data within objects being logged must be redacted or omitted. Use structured logging where possible and implement filters or formatters to sanitize log messages before they are written.
- **Error Messages**: User-facing error messages must be generic and **never** reveal PHI or internal system details that could aid an attacker. Internal error details (like stack traces) should only be logged securely (see Section 6).
- **Data Flow**: PHI access is restricted based on authorization rules. Data mapping (e.g., from ORM models to DTOs) should ensure only necessary, non-sensitive fields are exposed at API boundaries unless explicitly required and authorized.
- **Sanitization/Redaction**: Implement helper functions or decorators to consistently sanitize data structures before logging or potentially exposing them in non-secure contexts. Libraries might be used for pattern-based redaction (e.g., for SSNs, specific identifiers).

## 6. Secure Error Handling

- **Centralized Exception Handling**: FastAPI's exception handlers (`@app.exception_handler(...)`) must be used to catch unhandled exceptions globally.
- **Generic User Responses**: Custom exception handlers should catch specific application exceptions (e.g., `NotFound`, `PermissionDenied`) and standard Python exceptions, returning generic, non-revealing HTTP responses (e.g., 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden, 500 Internal Server Error) with minimal, non-PHI error details in the response body.
- **Secure Internal Logging**: When exceptions occur:
    - Log the full traceback and relevant context internally for debugging.
    - **Critically**: Ensure that any context variables included in the internal log message (e.g., function arguments, local variables captured in the traceback) are sanitized to remove or redact PHI *before* logging.
    - Assign a unique identifier (e.g., UUID) to the logged error event and include this ID in the generic error response sent to the user. This allows correlation for support without exposing internal details.

## 7. Input Validation

- **Pydantic Models**: FastAPI's integration with Pydantic is used extensively. Define strict Pydantic models for all request bodies and query parameters to validate data types, formats, lengths, and constraints, preventing invalid data from reaching application logic.
- **Path Parameters**: Use appropriate types (e.g., `UUID`, `int`) for path parameters to leverage FastAPI's built-in validation.

## 8. Output Sanitization

- **Response Models**: Use FastAPI's `response_model` parameter in route decorators. Define specific Pydantic models for responses to ensure only intended fields are included in the API output, preventing accidental leakage of sensitive ORM model attributes or other internal data.
- **Explicit Checks**: For complex scenarios or where `response_model` is insufficient, explicitly map internal data structures to response DTOs, ensuring PHI is not inadvertently included.

## 9. Audit Logging

- **Scope**: Comprehensive audit logs must be generated for security-sensitive events, including:
    - User login attempts (success/failure)
    - Access to PHI (creation, read, update, deletion)
    - Administrative actions (user permission changes, configuration updates)
    - Key system events (startup, shutdown, critical errors)
- **Content**: Audit logs should include timestamp, user ID/service ID performing the action, action performed, target resource/patient ID (if applicable), source IP address, and outcome (success/failure).
- **Storage & Protection**: Audit logs must be stored securely, protected from tampering, and retained according to policy requirements. Access must be restricted to authorized personnel.
- **Implementation**: [Specify how audit logging is implemented - e.g., dedicated logging stream, database table, middleware hooks].

## 10. Security Testing

- **Static Analysis (SAST)**: Tools like Bandit should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to detect common security vulnerabilities in the code.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Tools like Safety should be used to check for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- **Dynamic Analysis (DAST)**: Tools like OWASP ZAP can be used periodically against running environments (staging) to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
- **Manual Reviews & Pentesting**: Regular code reviews and periodic penetration testing are essential for uncovering complex vulnerabilities.
- **Dedicated Tests**: The `/backend/app/tests/security/` directory contains automated tests verifying specific security controls (See `80_Testing_Guide.md`).
