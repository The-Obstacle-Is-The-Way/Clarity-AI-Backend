Clarity AI Digital Twin Platform: Comprehensive Technical Dossier
Executive Summary
Clarity AI represents a revolutionary HIPAA-compliant platform that creates computational "digital twins" of psychiatric patients, transforming fragmented clinical data into integrated predictive models that evolve in real-time. This platform bridges the critical gap in psychiatric care by providing objective, quantitative measurements and predictions where traditional assessments rely heavily on subjective self-reporting and infrequent clinical observations.

Digital Twin Concept & Implementation
What is a Psychiatric Digital Twin?
A digital twin in mental health is a computational representation of a patient's mental health state that:

Evolves continuously as new data is incorporated
Integrates multi-modal inputs (biometric, clinical, genetic, behavioral)
Enables predictive insights and personalized treatment recommendations
Provides continuous monitoring between clinical appointments
Identifies patterns and correlations invisible to traditional assessment
