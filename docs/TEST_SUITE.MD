If grinding those last reds to green feels like the straightest path for you right now, it isn’t “wrong.” There’s genuine value in watching the failure count drop: you learn the codebase, you tighten loose joins, and when the suite finally prints “0 failed” you’ll get a real confidence boost. Just keep two things in mind while you work through the stack-traces.

First, many of the remaining failures are mapper errors that bubble up dozens of times from the same root cause. Fixing a single duplicate SQLAlchemy model or broken import can wipe out thirty or forty red lines in one shot. Look at the very top of each failure trace—if they all mention Mapper[AnalyticsEventModel] cannot locate a table, then spend an hour correcting that model definition (unique __tablename__, matching Base.metadata) instead of patching each test individually. Often one schema tweak or adding a missing Alembic migration flips a big chunk of the suite to green.

Second, remember why the test exists. If a test expects behaviour you don’t intend to ship—say, it asserts that a stubbed ML service returns a hard-coded score—then making that pass is busywork. Before sinking time, read the assertion in plain English: does that rule matter to your MVP? If yes, fix the code. If no, you can still silence it without complex marking: add a single line at the top of the test file:

import pytest
pytest.skip("Feature not on current roadmap", allow_module_level=True)

That one liner skips the whole module and never touches your production code, so you avoid the indentation and tagging headaches you hit before.

But if your gut says, “I’m close, the red number keeps dropping, finishing the set will clear my head,” go for it. Just be strategic: attack the shared root causes first, and don’t be afraid to short-circuit tests that guard placeholders you plan to rip out anyway. Once the scoreboard is clean, freeze the suite, commit the green baseline, and move on to wiring real models and security hardening with a lighter heart.
