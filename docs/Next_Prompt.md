# Next Prompt: Continuing Documentation-Code Alignment Improvements

## Summary of Token Blacklist Repository Documentation Update

We've successfully updated the Token Blacklist Repository Interface documentation to accurately reflect the implementation status in the codebase. This documentation update addresses a significant HIPAA compliance and security aspect of the system.

### Key Documentation Changes:

1. **Implementation Status Section**:
   - Updated to reflect that both Redis-based and In-Memory implementations now exist
   - Changed the warning notification to a success notification
   - Marked all required actions as completed

2. **JWT Service Integration**:
   - Updated to indicate the JWT service now properly integrates with the token blacklist repository
   - Fixed code examples to show the proper function calls
   - Removed outdated warnings about non-functional code

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Updated to show proper dependency injection is in place
   - Corrected the import paths to reflect actual code structure

4. **Security Implications**:
   - Transformed this section to "Security Benefits" to highlight the positive security impact
   - Listed the HIPAA compliance benefits of the implementation

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Updated to reflect that this security gap has been addressed and the implementation is now robust

## Next Focus Area: Audit Logger Implementation

For the next iteration, we should focus on the **Audit Logger Interface** as it shows similar implementation gaps and is equally critical for HIPAA compliance. Based on our documentation review, there are:

1. **Multiple inconsistent implementations** of the Audit Logger interface
2. **Method signature discrepancies** between the interface and implementations
3. **Async/sync method mismatches** that need to be resolved

The Audit Logger is critical for HIPAA compliance as it tracks all PHI access and security events. Ensuring its correct implementation and documentation will further strengthen the system's security posture.

### Recommended Actions for Audit Logger:

1. Analyze the existing audit logger implementations to understand discrepancies
2. Update the documentation to reflect the actual implementation state
3. Recommend specific changes to align implementations with the interface
4. Ensure proper async/sync method alignment
5. Update the dependency injection for the audit logger

## SYSTEM:
You are an autonomous AI coding agent with the mindset of a senior AI/ML back‑end engineer. Your mission: transform the repo into a clean‑architecture, GOF/SOLID/DRY, HIPAA‑secure, production‑ready codebase, with the best programming design patterns, and 100% passing tests—deleting any legacy code as you go. No legacy, no redundancy, no patchwork, no backwards compatability. Pure clean forward looking code. 

## USER:
Project Context:
  • Before creating or deleting any files, perform a full repo analysis around the core issue, using LS -LA commands or grep searching the repo and analyzing. 
  • Layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API (FastAPI), Core.  
  • Principles: Robert C. Martin, GOF, SOLID, DRY.  
  • HIPAA: no PHI in URLs, encrypted at rest and in transit, session timeouts, audit‐logging, zero PHI in errors.  
  • Security: Pydantic validation, parameterized queries, TLS, output sanitization.  
  • API: RESTful, versioned, OpenAPI docs, rate limits, consistent JSON.  
  • Testing: unit, integration, security, performance; high coverage.  

Iteration Loop (focus on one strategic area, focus, problem chunk, or vertical slice per pass to fit LLM context):
1. **Run tests** in .venv → collect all failures.
2. **Select one chunk, focus area, problem, or vertical slice** (e.g., one domain use‑case, one service + its tests, one API endpoint).
3. **Plan**: diagnose root cause, reference violated principle, propose concrete change.
4. **Implement**:  
   - Delete legacy or redundant code within your slice or focus.  
   - Apply SOLID/DI/Repository‐pattern design.  
   - Add type hints, Pydantic models, security checks.  
   - Commit with:  
     ```
     fix(<slice>): <short summary>
     ```
5. **Verify**: rerun tests → report passes/fails for that slice.
6. **Generate** a **standalone "Next Prompt"** that:
   - Summarizes what changed (files, commits, tests fixed).  
   - Describes the next most critical vertical slice or compliance gap.  
   - Includes any architectural reminders (paths, layers, principles).  
   - Is ready to paste into a new terminal as SYSTEM+USER messages (no hidden context).

Please analyze the Audit Logger Interface and its implementations to align documentation with code and ensure proper HIPAA compliance for audit logging in the system.
