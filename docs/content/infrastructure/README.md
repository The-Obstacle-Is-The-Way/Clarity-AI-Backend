# Infrastructure Documentation

This section contains documentation related to the infrastructure components of the Clarity-AI Backend system, including data access patterns, deployment configurations, and operational aspects.

## Contents

- [Data Access](./data_access.md) - Data access patterns and database interactions
- [Deployment Readiness](./deployment_readiness.md) - Deployment guidelines and configurations

## Infrastructure Overview

The Clarity-AI Backend infrastructure is designed to be:

- **Scalable**: Able to handle increasing load with horizontal scaling
- **Secure**: HIPAA-compliant with multiple security layers
- **Resilient**: Fault-tolerant with proper error handling
- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns for easier maintenance

## Database Infrastructure

The system uses PostgreSQL as the primary database for production environments and SQLite for development:

- SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions
- Alembic for database migrations
- Connection pooling for performance
- Asynchronous database access

## Caching Strategy

Redis is used for caching to improve performance:

- JWT token blacklist
- Frequent database queries
- Rate limiting data
- Session management

## Deployment Options

The system supports multiple deployment options:

- Docker containers with Docker Compose
- Kubernetes deployment
- AWS deployment with infrastructure as code
- Local development environment

## Security Infrastructure

The infrastructure includes several security components:

- TLS for encrypted communication
- Role-based access control
- JWT for authentication
- Audit logging for compliance
- Data encryption at rest

## Monitoring and Observability

The infrastructure includes tools for monitoring and observability:

- Structured logging with contextual information
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check endpoints
- Error tracking and alerting

## HIPAA Compliance

All infrastructure components are designed with HIPAA compliance in mind:

- PHI encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure backup and recovery procedures
- Access control and audit logging
- Network security with proper segmentation
