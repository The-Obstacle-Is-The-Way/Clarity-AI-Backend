# Clarity-AI Backend Documentation

## Overview

Clarity-AI is a HIPAA-compliant platform that aims to create computational models of psychiatric patients using a "digital twin" approach. The platform is designed to integrate various data sources (biometric, clinical, behavioral) to provide clinicians with additional insights that may assist in psychiatric care.

## Core Capabilities

The backend provides several core capabilities:

- **Clean Architecture Implementation**: Structured according to domain-driven design principles with clear separation of concerns
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for data access and service integration
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Security measures designed to protect patient health information
- **Data Integration**: Systems for integrating multiple data sources
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Infrastructure for ML model deployment and inference

## Digital Twin Concept

A digital twin in this context refers to a computational model that:

- Integrates data from multiple sources
- Provides a consolidated view of patient information
- May enable analysis of patterns and relationships in the data
- Could potentially assist in monitoring changes between clinical appointments

This approach aims to complement traditional psychiatric assessment methods by providing additional quantitative data points, though the clinical efficacy of this approach is still being researched and validated.

## Key Components

The Clarity-AI Backend consists of several key components:

- **Authentication System**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Patient Management**: APIs for managing patient information
- **Biometric Alert System**: Framework for monitoring biometric data and generating alerts
- **Analytics Engine**: Systems for data analysis and insight generation
- **ML Services**: Integration with various machine learning models
- **Digital Twin Management**: APIs for creating and updating digital twin models

## Documentation Structure

## Development Status

The Clarity-AI Backend is actively under development. Some features are fully implemented while others are in various stages of development. Throughout this documentation, we clearly indicate the implementation status of each component.

!!! note "Research Context"
    The digital twin approach to psychiatric care is an emerging field. The efficacy of computational models in improving clinical outcomes is still being researched. This platform provides the technical infrastructure to enable such research and potential clinical applications, but specific claims about clinical improvements require proper validation through clinical studies.
