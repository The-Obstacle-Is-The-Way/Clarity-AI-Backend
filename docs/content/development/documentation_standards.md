# Documentation Standards

This document outlines the documentation standards and quality assurance processes used in the Clarity-AI Backend project.

## Documentation Quality Tools

The Clarity-AI Backend project uses several tools to maintain high-quality documentation:

### MkDocs with Material Theme

The project documentation is built using MkDocs with the Material theme, providing:

- Clean, professional appearance
- Excellent search functionality
- Code highlighting
- Mobile-responsive design
- Versioning capabilities

### Markdown Linting

All documentation is validated using `markdownlint-cli` to ensure consistent formatting and readability:

```bash
# Check all markdown files
./scripts/lint_markdown.sh

# Check specific files
./scripts/lint_markdown.sh docs/content/architecture/*.md
```

The linting rules are defined in `.markdownlint.json` and enforce:

- Consistent heading structure
- Proper list formatting
- Code block standards
- Line length guidelines
- Proper capitalization of technical terms

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks ensure documentation quality is maintained with each commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hooks
pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) includes:

- Markdown linting
- YAML validation
- Trailing whitespace removal
- End-of-file fixing
- Python code linting and formatting

## Documentation Structure

The documentation follows a structured organization:

```
docs/content/
├── index.md                     # Home page
├── architecture/                # Architecture documentation
├── api/                         # API reference
├── implementation/              # Implementation details
├── development/                 # Development guides
└── reference/                   # Reference materials
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Factual Accuracy

- All documentation must accurately reflect the current codebase
- Code examples should be tested and verified
- Implementation status should be clearly indicated
- Only include verifiable claims about capabilities

### HIPAA Compliance

Documentation related to HIPAA compliance should:

- Accurately describe security measures without revealing vulnerabilities
- Explain PHI handling procedures without including actual PHI
- Reference relevant HIPAA regulations where appropriate
- Use proper terminology for security concepts

### Architecture Documentation

When documenting architecture:

- Clearly separate layers according to clean architecture principles
- Document interfaces before implementations
- Explain design patterns and their application
- Provide diagrams that reflect the actual implementation

### API Documentation

API documentation should include:

- Endpoint URL and HTTP method
- Request parameters and body schema
- Response format and status codes
- Authentication requirements
- Implementation status indicator
- Example requests and responses

## Documentation Maintenance

### Update Process

When code changes affect documentation:

1. Identify all documentation files that need updating
2. Update the content to reflect the new implementation
3. Run markdown linting to ensure formatting standards
4. Verify the documentation builds correctly with MkDocs
5. Submit documentation changes with the code PR

### Review Criteria

Documentation PRs are reviewed for:

- Technical accuracy
- Compliance with formatting standards
- Completeness of coverage
- HIPAA compliance considerations
- Clarity and readability
- Appropriate cross-referencing

## Versioning

Documentation versioning follows these principles:

- Major architectural changes warrant new documentation versions
- API versioning should be reflected in documentation
- Historical documentation is maintained for deprecated features
- Version indicators should be clearly visible
