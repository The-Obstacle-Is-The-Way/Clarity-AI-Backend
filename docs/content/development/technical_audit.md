pip install cryptography authlib
# Replace python-jose and ecdsa usage
```

**Impact**: Eliminates all critical security vulnerabilities

### Phase 2: Professional Presentation (2-4 hours) 🎯
**Priority**: High
**Risk**: Very Low

```bash
# Line length standardization
black app/ --line-length=88
# Remaining style fixes
ruff check app/ --fix
```

**Impact**: Dramatic improvement in code readability

### Phase 3: Documentation Polish (4-6 hours) 📚
**Priority**: Medium-High  
**Risk**: None

- Add docstrings to public APIs
- Expand inline documentation
- Update architectural documentation

**Impact**: Demonstrates professional development practices
