## Development Environment Setup

To set up a development environment for the Clarity-AI Backend, follow the steps in the [Installation Guide](./installation_guide.md).

## Development Workflow

The development workflow follows these steps:

1. **Setup**: Install dependencies and set up the development environment
2. **Branch**: Create a feature branch for your work
3. **Develop**: Implement changes following coding standards
4. **Test**: Write and run tests to ensure code quality
5. **Document**: Update documentation to reflect changes
6. **Review**: Submit a pull request for code review
7. **Iterate**: Address feedback and make necessary changes
8. **Merge**: Merge changes into the main branch

## Coding Standards

The project follows these coding standards:

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- **Type Hinting**: All Python code uses type hints
- **Docstrings**: All functions, classes, and modules have docstrings
- **Testing**: Unit tests for all business logic, integration tests for APIs
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with custom exceptions
- **HIPAA Compliance**: No PHI in logs, secure data handling
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Async/await pattern for IO-bound operations

## Testing

The project uses pytest for testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app

# Run a specific test file
pytest app/tests/unit/domain/test_patient.py
```

## Continuous Integration

The project uses CI/CD pipelines for:

- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Security scanning
- Documentation generation
