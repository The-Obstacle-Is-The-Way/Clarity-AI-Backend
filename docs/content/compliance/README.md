# Compliance Documentation

This section contains documentation related to regulatory compliance for the Clarity-AI Backend system, with a primary focus on HIPAA compliance.

## Contents

- [HIPAA Compliance](./hipaa_compliance.md) - Comprehensive overview of HIPAA compliance measures

## HIPAA Compliance Overview

The Clarity-AI Backend is designed from the ground up to be HIPAA-compliant, ensuring the protection of Protected Health Information (PHI) at all levels of the system. Key compliance features include:

### Technical Safeguards

- **Access Control**: Role-based access control with proper authentication and authorization
- **Encryption**: PHI encrypted both in transit (TLS) and at rest
- **Audit Controls**: Comprehensive audit logging of all PHI access
- **Integrity Controls**: Data validation and checksums to ensure data integrity
- **Transmission Security**: Secure communication channels for all data transmission

### Administrative Safeguards

- **Risk Analysis**: Regular security risk assessments
- **Security Management**: Policies and procedures for security incidents
- **Information Access Management**: Clear procedures for granting access to PHI
- **Contingency Planning**: Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- **Training**: Documentation for security training requirements

### Physical Safeguards

- **Facility Access Controls**: Guidelines for physical access to systems
- **Workstation Security**: Policies for secure workstation usage
- **Device and Media Controls**: Procedures for hardware and media handling

## Security Implementation

The HIPAA compliance measures are implemented across all layers of the architecture:

- **Domain Layer**: Core entities designed with PHI security in mind
- **Application Layer**: Business rules that enforce HIPAA requirements
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Security implementations (encryption, audit logging)
- **Presentation Layer**: Secure API endpoints with proper authentication

## PHI Handling Guidelines

The documentation provides guidelines for handling PHI in the codebase:

- No PHI in URLs or query parameters
- No PHI in logs or error messages
- Proper consent management
- Minimum necessary data access
- Secure session management

## Compliance Validation

The system includes tools and procedures for validating HIPAA compliance:

- Static analysis tools for detecting potential PHI leaks
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Audit log analysis tools
- Compliance checklists and documentation
