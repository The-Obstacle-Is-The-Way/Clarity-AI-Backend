# Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT) Service

## Overview

The Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT) Service is a specialized machine learning component within the Clarity AI Backend that analyzes patient data to derive psychiatric insights. This service represents a breakthrough approach in psychiatric assessment, using various data sources including actigraphy to identify markers of mental health conditions, monitor treatment efficacy, and provide objective data for the digital twin.

## Clean Architecture Implementation

The PAT Service exemplifies clean architecture principles through:

1. **Interface Segregation**: The interface defines clear, cohesive methods without unnecessary dependencies
2. **Dependency Inversion**: Higher-level modules depend on the abstract interface, not concrete implementations
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each method has a specific, well-defined purpose
4. **Domain-Driven Design**: The interface represents a bounded context within psychiatric assessment

## Interface Definition

The PAT Service interface is defined in `app/core/interfaces/services/ml/pat_interface.py`:

```python
class PATInterface(ABC):
    """
    Interface for psychiatric assessment tool services.
    
    PAT services analyze patient data and provide clinical insights,
    predictions, and digital twin modeling capabilities.

## Key Capabilities

### Patient Analysis

The PAT Service processes patient data to extract clinically relevant insights:

```python
async def analyze_patient(
    self, 
    patient_id: str, 
    data: dict[str, Any],
    include_risk_factors: bool = True,
    include_recommendations: bool = True
) -> dict[str, Any]:
```

This method transforms various data sources into psychiatric insights such as:

- Mental state assessment
- Behavioral pattern identification
- Symptom analysis
- Treatment response indicators
- Functional status metrics

### Risk Prediction

The service can predict specific risk factors for patients:

```python
async def predict_risk(
    self,
    patient_id: str,
    risk_type: str,
    timeframe_days: int,
    data: dict[str, Any] | None = None
) -> dict[str, Any]:
```

This method evaluates the likelihood of various psychiatric risks, such as:

- Suicidal ideation or behavior
- Hospital readmission
- Treatment non-adherence
- Symptom exacerbation
- Crisis episodes

### Digital Twin Creation

The service can generate digital twin models that represent patients:

```python
async def create_digital_twin(
    self, 
    patient: Patient,
    include_features: list[str] = None
) -> DigitalTwin:
```

The digital twin represents a computational model of the patient that can be used for:

- Treatment simulation
- Outcome prediction
- Longitudinal tracking
- Multimodal data integration
- Personalized intervention planning

### Digital Twin Updates

The service can update existing digital twins with new patient data:

```python
async def update_digital_twin(
    self,
    digital_twin_id: str,
    new_data: dict[str, Any]
) -> DigitalTwin:
```

This allows for:

- Real-time model evolution
- Continuous learning from new observations
- Adaptive prediction based on treatment response
- Temporal pattern recognition
- Change detection in patient status

### Model Information

The service provides metadata about its underlying models:

```python
async def get_model_info(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
```

This method returns information about:

- Model versions and capabilities
- Training data characteristics
- Validation metrics
- Feature importance
- Model limitations and constraints

## Service Implementations

### Production Implementation

The primary implementation uses advanced machine learning models for analysis:

```python
class ProductionPAT(PATInterface):
    """Production implementation of the PAT service."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._initialized = False
        self._models = {}
        self._config = None
```

Key features of this implementation:

- State-of-the-art ML models
- Integration with clinical knowledge bases
- Continuous model updates
- Multi-dimensional data processing
- HIPAA-compliant data handling

### Mock Implementation

A mock implementation is provided for testing and development:

```python
class MockPAT(PATInterface):
    """Mock implementation of the PAT service for testing."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._initialized = False
        self._config = None
        
    async def initialize(self) -> bool:
        """Initialize the mock PAT service."""
        self._initialized = True
        return True
```

This implementation returns deterministic, simulated results for unit testing and development without external dependencies.

## Integration with Digital Twin

The PAT Service is tightly integrated with the Digital Twin system, providing comprehensive psychiatric assessments that complement other data sources:

1. **Multimodal Integration**: Combines PAT insights with other data sources
2. **Temporal Modeling**: Tracks changes in psychiatric state over time
3. **Intervention Simulation**: Models potential outcomes of different treatments
4. **Personalized Metrics**: Develops individualized baselines and trajectories
5. **Feedback Loops**: Incorporates treatment response data into future predictions

## HIPAA Compliance

The PAT Service implements strict security measures:

1. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary information is processed
2. **Secure Processing**: All sensitive data is handled securely
3. **Access Control**: Strict authentication and authorization
4. **Audit Logging**: All PHI access is logged and monitored
5. **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the PAT Service include:

1. **Advanced NLP**: Integration of natural language processing for text analysis
2. **Multimodal Learning**: Combined analysis of various data modalities
3. **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving model training across institutions
4. **Explainable AI**: More transparent reasoning for clinical insights
5. **Real-time Processing**: Immediate analysis of incoming patient data

## Architectural Considerations

The current PAT Service implementation follows clean architecture principles, but has opportunities for refinement:

1. **Interface Consolidation**: Ensure consistent interfaces across the system
2. **Dependency Injection**: Standardize DI patterns for all service instances
3. **Repository Pattern**: Improve data access through dedicated repositories
4. **Domain Model Alignment**: Ensure full alignment with domain entities
5. **Test Harness**: Develop comprehensive test suite for all implementations
