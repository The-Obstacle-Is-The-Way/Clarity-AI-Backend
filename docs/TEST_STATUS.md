## Warning Categories

The 254 warnings in the test suite fall into several categories:

1. **Pydantic V2 Deprecation Warnings (112 instances)**:
   - Pattern: Use of `.dict()` instead of `.model_dump()`
   - Fix: Replace all `.dict()` calls with `.model_dump()`
   - Affected files: Primarily in schema validation and API endpoint handlers

2. **Datetime Deprecation Warnings (64 instances)**:
   - Pattern: Use of `datetime.utcnow()` instead of `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`
   - Fix: Update to use timezone-aware datetime creation
   - Affected files: Timestamp generation in entities and repositories

3. **Test Event Loop Warnings (43 instances)**:
   - Pattern: Event loop fixture redefinition across test files
   - Fix: Consolidate event loop fixtures in conftest.py
   - Impact: Potential test interference if not addressed

4. **HTTPX Deprecation Warnings (27 instances)**:
   - Pattern: Use of deprecated `app` shortcut instead of explicit `ASGITransport`
   - Fix: Update test client initialization to use ASGITransport
   - Example: `AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test")`

5. **Asyncio Marking Inconsistencies (8 instances)**:
   - Pattern: Tests marked with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` but not implemented as async functions
   - Fix: Either remove decorator or make function async
   - Impact: Tests may fail in future pytest-asyncio versions

## Next Steps

See [DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](./DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) for the strategic plan to address skipped tests and warnings.
