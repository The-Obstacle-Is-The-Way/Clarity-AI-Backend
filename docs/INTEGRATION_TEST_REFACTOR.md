# Integration Test Refactoring

## Completed Work

1. **Restructured Test Organization**
   - Created a clean v1-based directory structure for API tests
   - Moved tests to appropriate locations based on clean architecture principles
   - Removed redundant and problematic test files
   - Created README.md with documentation about the new structure

2. **Fixed Test Collection Errors**
   - Added missing imports in `datetime_utils.py`
   - Added required functions in auth dependencies
   - Fixed import errors that prevented tests from being collected

3. **Added Helper Tools**
   - Created test reorganization script (`scripts/reorganize_tests.py`)
   - Added test organization diagnostic tools
   - Documented clean architecture principles for tests

## Current Status

- All moved tests are now passing
- Directory structure follows clean architecture principles
- Tests are organized by architectural layer
- API tests follow the API versioning structure

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Empty Directories**
   - Either add tests or remove empty directories
   - Ensure proper `__init__.py` files are in place

2. **Standardize Naming Conventions**
   - Update remaining test files to follow naming conventions
   - Ensure all test files start with `test_`

3. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add missing tests for critical components
   - Ensure HIPAA compliance features are properly tested
   - Add security and authentication tests

4. **Implement CI/CD Integration**
   - Add automated test runs
   - Implement test coverage reporting
   - Add performance benchmarking

## How to Run Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
python -m pytest
```

Run integration tests:
```bash
python -m pytest app/tests/integration/
```

Run specific test files:
```bash
python -m pytest app/tests/integration/api/v1/endpoints/xgboost/test_xgboost.py -v
```

## Using the Test Organization Tool

Check for organization issues:
```bash
./scripts/reorganize_tests.py check
```

Create clean architecture directory structure:
```bash
./scripts/reorganize_tests.py create-dirs
```
