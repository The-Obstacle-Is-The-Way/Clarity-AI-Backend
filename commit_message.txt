fix(tests): migrate biometric processor standalone tests to proper unit tests

- Create migration script to automate standalone test migration process
- Migrate biometric event processor tests as a proof of concept
- Update tests to work with actual implementation instead of duplicated code
- Remove placeholder test since actual tests are now implemented
- Add comprehensive documentation for ongoing test migration process

This commit resolves the duplication issue between standalone tests and actual
implementation code, improving maintainability and test quality.
