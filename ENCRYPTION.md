# Encryption Implementation Plan for Clarity Digital Twin

## Key Findings from Industry Best Practices

### HIPAA Compliance Requirements
- **Encryption Requirement**: HIPAA requires PHI to be encrypted both at rest and in transit
- **Implementation Standard**: Must use NIST-approved encryption algorithms (FIPS 140-3)
- **Key Management**: Proper key rotation and access controls required
- **Audit Logging**: All access to PHI must be logged with detailed information

### NIST Recommendations (SP 800-111)
- **Algorithm Standard**: AES-256 is recommended for healthcare data
- **Mode of Operation**: GCM is preferred over CBC for better performance and security
- **Authentication**: Authenticated encryption (AEAD) provides data integrity validation
- **Key Derivation**: Use PBKDF2 with sufficient iterations (>10,000) for key derivation

### Mental Health Data Special Considerations
- **Heightened Sensitivity**: Mental health data is considered particularly sensitive
- **Segmentation**: Separate encryption contexts for different data categories
- **Authorization Controls**: Fine-grained access controls beyond basic encryption
- **De-identification**: Techniques to anonymize data when full records aren't needed

## Digital Twin Implementation Strategy
- **Layered Encryption**: Implement both field-level and database-level encryption
- **Encryption Key Hierarchy**: Use master keys, data encryption keys, and key encryption keys
- **Version Control**: Include version prefix in encrypted data for future algorithm upgrades
- **Performance Optimization**: Cache frequently used encryption contexts

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix Current Encryption Architecture (Immediate)
- Refactor `BaseEncryptionService` to handle all input types properly
- Enhance `EncryptedJSON` type to properly serialize Pydantic models
- Add comprehensive error handling and feedback
- Implement correct byte/string conversions throughout

### 2. Enhance Security (Short-term)
- Upgrade to AES-256-GCM from potentially weaker algorithms
- Implement authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
- Add encryption key versioning for future algorithm changes
- Implement proper key rotation mechanisms

### 3. Optimize Performance (Medium-term)
- Add caching of encryption contexts for frequently accessed data
- Optimize serialization of complex nested objects
- Implement batched encryption for bulk operations
- Add compression for large objects before encryption

### 4. Add Advanced Features (Long-term)
- Field-level encryption for partial access scenarios
- Searchable encryption for specific fields
- Homomorphic techniques for analytics on encrypted data
- Implement secure multi-party computation for collaborative care

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests for all encryption/decryption operations
- Test vector validation against NIST test cases
- Performance benchmarking for encryption operations
- Fault injection testing for error handling validation

## Error Resolution Plan
1. Fix serialization of complex objects in `EncryptedJSON`
2. Correct handling of byte/string conversions in encryption services
3. Implement proper error messages and exception handling
4. Add robust type checking before encryption operations
5. Ensure version prefixes are correctly handled in all cases
