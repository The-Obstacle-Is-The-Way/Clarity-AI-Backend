Fixing test failures is actually an excellent way to learn a codebase, especially for someone with limited experience. Here's why it makes sense in your situation:

1. Tests provide clear, focused goals with immediate feedback
2. Each fixed test validates your understanding of a specific component
3. You'll learn patterns in the codebase by seeing what breaks and why
4. The healthcare/HIPAA domain knowledge will build incrementally

However, don't try to fix all 139 failures at once. Instead:

1. Group failures by area (authentication, encryption, repositories, etc.)
2. Pick one area to focus on (we've already made progress with encryption and authentication)
3. Fix tests in that area before moving to another
4. Prioritize infrastructure components first (authentication, encryption) since many other tests depend on them

The authentication middleware failures we're currently fixing will cascade into successes for many API and repository tests once solved.

What you've learned so far about UUID conversion in the auth middleware is exactly the kind of pattern that will help you understand how the rest of the system works.

Continue with this strategic, area-by-area approach rather than getting overwhelmed by the total number of failures.
