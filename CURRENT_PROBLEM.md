# Debugging Session Analysis (2025-05-14 11:06)

## Latest Failure
- **Error:** `NameError: name 'Union' is not defined` raised during import of `app/tests/conftest.py`.
- **Origin:** `app/infrastructure/security/auth/authentication_service.py`, method `logout(self, tokens: Union[str, List[str]]) -> bool`.
- **Cause:** `typing.Union` (and `typing.List`) are referenced in type hints but **not imported** in the module, so evaluation of the class body fails at import-time, breaking `pytest` collection.
- **Impact:** Pytest aborts before running tests (exit code 4). All downstream tests are blocked.

## Proposed Fix (Vertical Slice: Security → Auth Service)
1. **Add missing imports** at top of `authentication_service.py`:
   ```python
   from typing import Union, List
   ```
   (or migrate to PEP 604 style `str | list[str]` if we want to modernize.)
2. Ensure no other modules reference `Union`/`List` without import—grep for `Union[` across `app/infrastructure/security`.
3. Re-run tests to confirm collection succeeds and identify next failing slice.

## Next Steps After Fix
- Re-run `pytest`.
- Expect remaining tests to pass (1309 green last run) except any new failures.
- Continue cleaning missing imports & legacy typing across codebase.
